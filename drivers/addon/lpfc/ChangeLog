Changes from 20040507 to 20040515

	* Changing version to 7.0.1.
	* Fixed bug in lpfc_tasklet.  lpfc_tasklet was recursively called

	* Change version to 7.0.0

	  lpfc_sli.c.
	* Change elx_sli_issue_mbox_wait to return correct error code to
	  the caller.
	* In some of the els completion routines, after calling
	  lpfc_elx_chk_latt, driver ignores the return code of the
	  lpfc_elx_chk_latt. This will prevent the discovery state machine
	  restarting correctly when there are link events in the middle of
	  discovery state machine running. Fix this by exiting discovery
	  state machine if lpfc_els_chk_latt returns a non zero value.
	* Removed MAX_LPFC_BRDS from lpfc_diag.h

	  lpfc_sli_issue_iocb_wait now sleeps uninterruptible.
	* Replace list_for_each() with list_for_each_safe() when a list
	  element could be deleted.
	* Fix IOCB memory leak

	  lpfc_instcnt, lpfc_instance[], and pHba[] into lpfcDRVR
	  structure Added routines lpfc_get_phba_by_inst()
	  lpfc_get_inst_by_phba() lpfc_check_valid_phba()
	* Turn on attributes "set" & "params" by default.
	* Further formatting/whitespace/line length cleanup on: lpfc_ct.c
	  lpfc_els.c lpfc_fcp.c lpfc_hbadisc.c lpfc_init.c lpfc_ipport.c
	  lpfc_mbox.c lpfc_nportdisc.c lpfc_sched.c lpfc_sched.h
	  lpfc_scsi.h lpfc_scsiport.c lpfc_sli.c and lpfc_sli.h
	* Add log message 249 to log any unsupported device addressing
	  modes encountered.

	* Cleanup use of several gotos not used for error exit.
	* Replace memcpy_toio() and memcpy_toio() with endian-dependent
	  lpfc_memcpy_to_slim() and lpfc_memcpy_from_slim() so that for
	  big endian hosts like PPC64, the SLIM is accessed 4 bytes at a
	  time instead of as a byte-stream.

Changes from 20040409 to 20040416

	* The scsi_register and scsi_alloc_host OS calls can fail and
	  return a zero-valued host pointer.  A ctrl-C on 2.6 kernels
	  during driver load will cause this and the driver to panic.
	  Fixed this bug.  Also found a bug in the error_x handling with
	  lpfc_sli_hba_down - it was in the wrong place and the driver
	  lock was not held, but needed to be (in lpfc_linux_attach) Fixed
	  both.  Did some minor comment clean up.
	* Removed unwanted (void *) castings.
	* Replace define of INVALID_PHYS, with kernel 2.6.5's
	  dma_mapping_error() and add a inline function for earlier
	  kernels.  Remove lpfc_bad_scatterlist().
	* Clean up formatting in hbaapi.h, lpfc.h, lpfc_cfgparm.h,
	  lpfc_crtn.h, lpfc_ct.c, lpfc_diag.h, lpfc_disc.h, lpfc_els.c,
	  lpfc_fcp.c, lpfc_hbadisc.c, lpfc_hw.h, lpfc_init.c,
	  lpfc_ipport.c, lpfc_logmsg.c, lpfc_logmsg.h and lpfc_scsiport.c
	  - mostly replacing groups of 8 spaces with hard tabs and keeping
	  lines to 80 column max..
	* Removed LPFC_DRVR_LOCK call from lpfc_unblock_requests for 2.4
	  kernels.  The lpfc_scsi_done routine already unlocks the driver
	  lock since it expects this lock to be held.
	* Removed global lock capabilities from driver lock routines
	* Remove SA_INTERRUPT flag from request_irq

	* Use Linux list macros for DMABUF_t
	* Break up ioctls into 3 sections, dfc, util, hbaapi
	  rearranged code so this could be easily seperated into a
	  differnet module later All 3 are currently turned on by
	  defines in lpfc_ioctl.c LPFC_DFC_IOCTL, LPFC_UTIL_IOCTL,
	  LPFC_HBAAPI_IOCTL
	* Misc cleanup: some goto's; add comments; clarify function
	  args

	* Put IPFC ifdef around two members of struct lpfc_nodelist.
	* Cleaned up iocb list using list macros and list_head data
	  structure.
	* lpfc_online() was missing some timer routines that were
	  started by lpfc_linux_attach().  These routines are now also
	  started by lpfc_online().  lpfc_offline() only stopped
	  els_timeout routine.  It now stops all timeout routines
	  associated with that hba.
	* Replace seperate next and prev pointers in struct
	  lpfc_bindlist with list_head type.  In elxHBA_t, replace
	  fc_nlpbind_start and _end with fc_nlpbind_list and use
	  list_head macros to access it.
	* Fix ulpStatus for aborting I/Os overlaps with newer firmware
	  ulpStatus values
	* Rework params_show/store to be consistent as the other

	* Removed variable fc_dbg_flg
	* Fixed a bug where HBA_Q_DEPTH was set incorrectly for
	  3-digit HBAs.  Also changed can_queue so midlayer will only

	* Wrapped lpfndd.o target in BUILD_IPFC ifdef.
	* Removed elx_os.h inclusion in implementation files.
	* Removed ELX_OS_IO_t data structure and put data direction
	  and non scatter/gather physical address into the scsi buffer
	  structure directly.  Moved DRVR_LOCK, putPaddr, getPaddr
	  macros and some defines into elx.h since they are required
	  by the whole driver.

	  ELX_DEVP ELX_READ_BPLIST ELX_RESET_QDEPTH ELX_STAT.
	* Step 1 of attempt to move all Debug ioctls to sysfs.
	  Implemented the following IOCTLs in sysfs: ELX_WRITE_HC

	  ELX_READ_HS ELX_READ_HA ELX_READ_CA ELX_READ_MB ELX_RESET
	  ELX_READ_HBA ELX_INSTANCE ELX_LIP.  Also introduced
	  attribute "set" to be used in conjuction with the above
	  attributes.
	* Removed DLINK, enque and deque declarations now that clock
	  doesn't use them anymore
	* Separated install rule so that BUILD_IPFC has to be set when
	  make is called in order for the install rule to attempt to
	  copy the lpfndd.o driver.  This change fixes a bug that
	  occurs because the install rule by default attempted to
	  install lpfndd.o, whereas the default make rule did not by
	  default build lpfndd.o.
	* Keep track if hbaapi index numbers need to be refreshed.
	* Removed prod_os.h from include list.
	* Removed LPFC_LOCK and LPFC_UNLOCK macros.  Added OS calls
	  into elx_os_scsiport.c.  This file is now empty.

	  into code directly and removed LPFC_LOCK_ and _UNLOCK_
	  macros
	* Remove references to "elx_clock.h"
	* Added utsname.h to include list.  The previous checkin to
	  elx_os.h removed its inclusion of utsname.h since there is
	  precious little in the file.  However, lpfcLINUXfcp.c needs
	  it and now has it.
	* Removed some commented-out code
	* Removed elx_lck_t data structure, stray elxDRVR_t type, and
	  include from file.  No longer used.
	* Removed two PCI Sync defines.  Removed includes - not
	  needed.  Cleaned up macro lines.
	* Added two functions from elxLINUXfcp.c.  These functions
	  were IPFC specific.

	  Removed elx_lck_t and added spinlock_t directly. Moved two
	  IPFC functions into lpfc_ipport.c
	* Moved IP specific structures to lpfc_ip.h file.
	* lpfc_ipfarp_timeout() uses system timer.  Remove all usages
	  of old internal clock support.
	* Made changes to compile without IPFC support for the default
	  build.  Added ifdef IPFC for all lpfc_ip.h includes.
	* Patched elx_free_scsi_buf
  	* Removed elx_sched.o from 2.6 dependencies
	* Reworked lpfc_pcimap.
	* Use Linux swap macros to replace ELX swapping macros
	  (SWAP_SHORT, SWAP_LONG, SWAP_DATA, SWAP_DATA16,

          timer.
	* Removed num_bufs and num_iocbs configuration parameters.
	* Fixed a memory corruption bug. This was caused by a memory
	  write to ndlp structure from lpfc_cmpl_els_acc function.
	  This ndlp structure was freed from lpfc_els_unsol_event.
	* lpfc_disc_timeout() and lpfc_establish_link_tmo() now use
	  system timer.  Also update lpfc_els_retry_delay() to do a
	  single lock release at the end.
	* Remove use of PAN (pseudo adapter number).
	* Reintroduced usage of the cross compiler for building on
	  ppc64 to remove build errors that were cropping up when
	  using the standard gcc compiler.
	* Fix no-unlock-before return in lpfc_els_retry_delay which was
	  causing  a deadlock on insmod in some environments.
	* Minor format changes fix up comments
	* Create utility clock function elx_start_timer() and
	  elx_stop_timer().  All timeout routines now use these common
	  routines.

	  syntax checking
	* Minor formatting changes remove ISCSI defines.
	* Fix typo in install target for 2.4 kernels.
	* Removed unused elx_scsi_add_timer extern function
	  declaration.
	* Cleanup casting around DMA masks.
	* Comment out lpfndd.o modules_install section as lpfndd.o is
	  not generated if CONFIG_NET_LPFC is not set. Also refer to

	  will not exist otherwise.
	* Removed unused malloc counters from lpfcLINUXfcp.c.
	* Remove some unnecessary #includes in lpfcLINUXfcp.c
	* Remove unncessary #includes in elxLINUXfcp.c

	  FC_MAX_SEGSZ and FC_MAX_POOL.

	  kernel compile. Does not recompile all files on every
	  build. Uses the kernel build's definitions of CFLAGS,
	  MODFLAGS etc. Removed "make rpm" option.
	* Removed unused #defines CLOSED, DEAD, OPENED, NORMAL_OPEN
	  and unneeded #include of elx_sched.h in elx.h.
	* Several log message updates
	* Add PCI_DEVICE_ID_FIREFLY for LP6000

	  multiple instances of the parameter switch into a single
