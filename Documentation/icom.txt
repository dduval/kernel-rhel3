This note describes how to set the internal modem country code for an IBM
icom serial device driver adapter.

If the icom serial device driver adapter you are using contains an internal 
modem you may need to configure your modem for your country.  You can use 
the proc file data provided by the icom driver to determine whether an 
internal modem is present.  Simply "cat /proc/tty/driver/icom" and analyze 
its output.  If the cable field in the icom proc file output indicates an 
"InternalModem" type (1) then that port contains an internal modem and may 
need to have its country code set.  Using a serial console, you will need 
to issue an AT commands to determine the current country code setting.  
The major and minor number of the port containing the internal modem can 
also be obtained from icom proc file data.  Using this information you can 
determine which tty device to open with your serial console.  Once the 
serial console is opened against the proper device, issue the command 
"ATI9" to the modem.  The first set of digits returned are the encoded 
country code setting for the modem (in decimal), eg.

>ATI9
>52
>
>(.$MTS0314\\MODEM\TIA0602,TIA0578\MultiTech Systems MT5656SMI-L38)
>
>OK

In this example, the country code setting of the modem is set to "52".  
By referencing the table below you can determine if the current country 
code is set correctly.  If you find that the country code is not set 
correctly, you will need to issue another command to the modem to set 
the country code.  

The command to set a new country code is "AT%T19,0,x", where x is the 
new country code (in hex), eg. to set a new country code for Japan, 
issue the command "AT%T19,0,10".  Use "ATI9" to verify the country code 
was set correctly.

(1) The older serial adapters supported by this device driver do not indicate
    when an Internal modem is present.  If the serial adapter installed in 
    your system is a model 2771 then Port 0 is the internal modem which may 
    require country code configuration.  If the serial adapter installed in 
    your system is a model 2772 (0609/0610), then both Port 0 and Port 1 are 
    internal modems which may require country code configuration.
