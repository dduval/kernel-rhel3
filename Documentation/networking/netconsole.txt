The netconsole module provides 3 pieces of functionality:

    1) generation of syslog messages which are delivered to a remote syslog
       server
    2) generation of netconsole messages which are delivered to a remote
       netdump server
    3) a network kernel crash dump facility

The configuration for the module is specified in the /etc/sysconfig/netdump
file, which is self-documented.  Once the parameters are specified in that
file, you can enable the module with a "service netdump start" command,
provided you have installed the netdump rpm.

Network drivers must implement a special hook in order to work with
netconsole.  The following drivers implement this functionality, and thus
can be used in conjunction with netconsole:
